# NNG Cinema — Educational Simulation Project (Flutter)

NNG Cinema is a Flutter-based educational project designed to simulate how a cinema ticket booking and entertainment management application could be architected.

This project is created for learning purposes to demonstrate:
- Clean Architecture in Flutter
- BLoC state management
- API integration patterns
- Firebase integration patterns
- UI/UX for a cinema booking scenario

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE
